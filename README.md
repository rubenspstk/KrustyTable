# KrustyTable 

## Overview

#### This project was made during the 24-hour Hackathon in my final week at the Code for All Bootcamp, where it secured the 4th place among 10 exceptional projects.

## Concept

#### The challenge involved a captivating twist, with 10 cartoon themes being randomly assigned to participating teams. Our fate led us to the beloved world of SpongeBob SquarePants, inspiring us to craft a dynamic Web App tailored for ordering at the renowned Krusty Krab Restaurant.
